# sass-example

This example compiles sass by programmatically invoking the sass compiler in [sass-compile.mjs](./sass-compile.mjs). This uses the normal importer.

In this example, `hello.scss` imports variables from both an in-repo package (`@example/theme`) and a third party package (`@blueprintjs/core`).
